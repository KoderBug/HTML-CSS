The Cinema Project 7 the Space Project were code along applications demonstrating how to put together a large HTML project and how CSS is used to style web pages.

My Website Project is the beginning of my personal profile page, this is currently a work in progress.  My working personal profile page is created using WordPress and can be found at michellehaffner.com.
